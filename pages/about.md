# About the Collection 

### This is a collection of selected Michigan gubernatorial executive orders scanned from paper documents held at the [Library of Michigan, State Law Library](https://www.michigan.gov/lawlibrary).

This mini-website is for researchers who already have a specific executive order number or wish to browse by year. This site does not search the text or subject matter of any executive orders. It only looks for years or executive order numeric designations. Executive order numeric designations may not be when they were issued. For example, [Executive Order 1965-13A](https://temoshee.github.io/executiveorders/items/cdm104755.html) was issued on April 18, [1966](https://temoshee.github.io/executiveorders/browse.html#1966).

### Created for quick lookups by library staff

Many of these documents may not be available online or elsewhere. Library patrons often request specific documents and may not be interested in searching the text of those documents. This inspired the creation of this website so library staff could quickly access documents for library patrons without working through a long list of full-text search results.

### A living knowledge base

We hope to develop and maintain this site as part of the regular course of doing business rather than having a separate project.
